# Running compute jobs

Now that we've SSHed in, we're connected to Picotte—but Picotte, like we saw in
the Introduction, is composed of many computers. SSHing into
`picottelogin.urcf.drexel.edu` just connects us to one of them, the so-called
"login node" ("node" just means one of the computers that make up the cluster).
But Picotte has nearly 100 nodes in it—how do we access the others?

The login node is a gateway to where the real work happens—the other nodes of
the cluster, which are called "compute nodes". You can think of this like a busy
medical office. The login node is the waiting room, and the compute nodes are
the examination rooms (where the work actually happens).

To access the compute nodes we need to submit a request to the *scheduler*. The
scheduler accepts requests for the cluster to do some work (called **jobs**), keeps track of all
pending jobs, and assigns them to compute nodes to run as capacity becomes
available. The scheduler helps ensure that the cluster's resources are used fairly by
balancing competing requests from different users and research groups[^scheduler].

Overview of Picotte access: From your computer, you access the login node using SSH. From there, you access the compute nodes by submitting requests to the scheduler.
:::

## Our first job

The scheduler used by Picotte is called
[SLURM](https://slurm.schedmd.com/overview.html). SLURM has [many
commands](https://slurm.schedmd.com/quickstart.html#commands), we'll learn a few
of the most important today.

SLURM commands generally start with the letter `s`. Let's run our first SLURM
command, `sinfo`:

~~~bash
sinfo
~~~

`sinfo` prints output that shows that status of all the nodes in the cluster.
It's pretty dense, with a lot of information. Don't worry about all of it for
now. We're just looking to see that there are nodes in the `idle` or `mixed`
state in the `def-sm` partition. If there aren't, that means the cluster is
busy, and we might have to wait a while to run our job.

Let's run our first job, using the following command[^srun]:

```
srun --partition=def-sm --account=workshopprj --pty /bin/bash
```

You should see something like this:

```
[jjp366@picotte001 ~]$ srun --partition=def-sm --account=workshopprj --pty /bin/bash
srun: job 11702109 queued and waiting for resources
srun: job 11702109 has been allocated resources
[jjp366@node038 ~]$
```

Importantly, you will see the prompt change. Previously, the prompt was
`<your username>@picotte001`, because you were on the login node. Now, you
are on a compute node—in this case, `node038` (you might be on a different
compute node).

Now we're finally where the real work happens! From here, you can run any other
commands your research requires—a Python script you wrote, open-source
bioinformatics tools, commercial structural analysis software—the sky's the
limit. We have [a lot of research software pre-installed on
Picotte](https://docs.urcf.drexel.edu/software/installed/) for you to use.

However, an interactive job like this might not be the best way to get work
done. More on that later, for now let's break down exactly what each of the
arguments in the command above means and why we need them:

`srun`

- The base command: this launches a single job on a compute node.

`/bin/bash`

- `srun` takes one argument: the command to run. `bin/bash` is the command to
   start a new `bash` shell.

`--pty`

- This option is short for "pseudo-terminal", this lets you run commands interactively rather
  than in a non-interactive batch mode (which we'll learn more about later).

`--partition=def-sm` and `--account=workshopprj`

- These options specify the account and partition the job should run under.
  These concepts merit more explanation in the next section.

### Accounts and partitions

Our first job submission immediately showed us two of the most important SLURM
concepts: accounts (the `--account` argument) and partitions (the `--partition`
argument).

#### Accounts

Confusingly, this is *not* your Picotte user account. SLURM has a separate
concept of "bank accounts" which is what's referred to here. You'll also see
these referred to as "SLURM accounts" or "projects" (and they typically end in
`prj`).

Every job submitted to the scheduler has to be associated with a single SLURM
account, which will be billed for the job's usage.

Typically, each research group has two projects:

- `groupnameprj` for paid, priority tier jobs
- `groupnamefreeprj` for free-tier jobs

For this workshop, we're all just using `workshopprj` which can only run
free-tier jobs. Picotte has two "tiers" of access, free and priority. You can
read more about Picotte usage rates and tiers [on our documentation
site](https://docs.urcf.drexel.edu/clusters/picotte/usage-rates/).

You can see all the SLURM accounts you have access to using the command:

```
sacctmgr show user $USER withassoc
```

#### Partitions

A "partition" is a group of compute nodes. Partitions are also sometimes called
"queues" or "job queues", because jobs are scheduled separately on different
partitions, so each is sort of has it's own "queue" of jobs waiting to run.

Partitions are typically groups of nodes with similar hardware. For example, the
`gpu` partition includes all Picotte nodes with GPUs, and the `bm` partition
("big memory") has nodes with much more memory than the typical compute node.

Partitions also can have different access policies, resource limits, and
billing. For example:

- `def-sm` is the standard free-tier partition. All free-tier projects have
  access, and jobs run here are not billed for, but this partition has small
  resource limits.
- `def` is the standard priority-tier partition. Only funded projects have
  access, and jobs must be paid for, but the resource limits of `def-sm` are
  removed.

All jobs must specify a partition to run in. Here we used the `def-sm`
partition, which is for standard free-tier jobs. You can read more about all the
available partitions
[here](https://docs.urcf.drexel.edu/clusters/picotte/usage-rates/).

----

Let's now exit the compute node and return to the login node:

~~~ bash
exit
~~~

This will bring you back to the login node. See how your prompt has changed back
to `picotte001`. It is important to note that you have to be on a login node to
request a compute node. One you are on the compute node, if you want to go to
another compute node, you have to exit first.

:::{admonition} Picotte is a shared resource
:class: warning
Please be considerate of others when submitting jobs. Remember that Picotte is a shared resource.
Don't request resources you don't plan on actually using.
:::

:::{admonition} Don't run computations on the login node
:class: important
When using Picotte, **you shouldn't run heavy computations on the login node**,
because the login node is shared between everyone who logs into Picotte, so your computations will
interfere with other people's login processes. Once in a job, you can do whatever you want, because
the resources assigned to your job (CPUs, memory, etc.) are given to it exclusively, so you won't
interfere with anyone else.
:::

[^scheduler]: In the medical office analogy, the scheduler is kind of like the
    receptionist: accepting requests for appointments from patients (compute
    jobs), balancing their competing needs, and scheduling them to different
    doctors (compute nodes).
[^srun]: If you're working through this on your own, outside of an official URCF
    workshop, the `--account=workshopprj` argument, as `workshopprj` is
    temporary and only works during the workshop. Replace `workshopprj` with the
    name of your research group's project for job submission, which should be in
    the email you got confirming your Picotte account's creation.
