# Shell Specifics

## Prompt

The prompt provides information to the user and means the shell is waiting for a command. 
The prompt in a bash shell usually consists of a dollar (`$`) sign and may also contain other 
information, such as `your username` and your current directory, i.e., `~`, which, as you will 
learn shortly, is short for your *home* directory. We will mostly refer to the prompt as 
just `$`, i.e.,

$

To execute a command, type it into the prompt and press `Enter`. When the command completes you be 
returned to the prompt.
