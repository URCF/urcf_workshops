# Introduction to Python Programming

This workshop introduces Python for those that have little to no programming
experience, and has two parts:

1. A quick introduction to Python and the basics of processing and visualizing
   data.
2. A more in-depth view into programming concepts in Python, including loops,
  conditions, functions, and debugging.

The workshop uses material from [Software Carpentry's *Programming with Python*
lesson](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/).


## Preparation

We'll be using JupyterLab as our Python environment for this workshop. **Be sure to follow the steps below and make sure they work for you prior to the start of the workshop.**

```{admonition} Update your browser
:class: warning

The version of JupyterLab we're using for the workshop, [JupyterLite](https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), requires an modern, self-updating browser. We recommend using the   latest   version of Chrome or Firefox, Safari and Edge may not work.

```


1. Go to https://urcf.github.io/python-workshop/
2. You should see the JupyterLab interface, which looks like this:

3. Double click on the "workshop.ipynb" notebook in the right-hand sidebar to open it. You should now see the notebook interface, which looks like this:

![Jupyter notebook](../fig/python_programming/00-index/intro_notebook.png)

4. Click into the code cell and press `Shift`+`Enter` to run the cell. You should see a plot of a sine wave appear below it. It make take a few seconds to load and display, be patient.

If this all worked, you're now ready for the workshop! If you encounter any issues, please [get in touch over email](mailto:urcf-support@drexel.edu) and we'll help you out.
