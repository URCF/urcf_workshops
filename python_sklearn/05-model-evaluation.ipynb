    "# Evaluating Machine Learning Models\n",

    "Machine learning is awesome, right?! Define \"awesome\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of machine learning algorithms is to **extract meaningful patterns** from training data either to help us understand that training data or to use those patterns to **make inferences** about new data (or both). If our goal is to better understand our training data, how do we know that the identified patterns are reliable insights into our data? If our goal is to make inferences about new data, how do we estimate the performance of our model on the new data? To succesfully apply machine learning methodology in research or industry applications, we must be able to answer these questions. While tools like IBM Watson greatly simplify the actual training of Machine Learning models, the careful evaluation of those models by the practicioner is indispensible.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will \n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Define what we mean by \"awesome\"\n",
    "    2. Introduce some common pitfalls on the road to awesome\n",
    "    3. Discuss how to calculate awesomeness\n",
    "    4. Leverage this knowledge to create even awesomer models\n",
    "    \n",
    "While this notebook include code examples, the content is intended for a general audience. The concepts that we discuss here have relevance for almost any data analysis project and should help you think critically and strategically whether you are a coder or not! If you do want to play with the code, feel free! You can double-click a cell to edit it. Press Shift+Enter to execute the cell. If you want to save your progress, you will first have to save a copy of the notebook to your drive. "

    "## Evaluating _Supervised_ Models\n",
    "In supervised learning, we fit a model that predicts a target variable $y$ given som input features $X$ by looking at lots of pre-labelled example pairs, $(y_1, X_1), (y_2, X_2), \\ldots, (y_N, X_N)$. These pre-labelled examples make the evaluation of supervised models relatively straightforward compared to unsupervised.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the remainder of this notebook, we will use an example from a political science project where we are modeling whether Tweets are political attacks based on the text of the tweet. The data set below includes our target column called `attack` and many feature columns called `tweet_vec_n` where n ranges from 1 to 75. In the attack column, 1s correspond to attacks and 0s correspond to non-attacks. The labels were assigned by humans. The `tweet_vec_n` columns form a numerical representation of the text of the tweet. Very similar tweets should have similar numbers. If this sounds crazy, don't worry about it for now as you won't need to understand this to understand the concepts in this notebook."

    "The number one rule for evaluating machine learning models is, **don't test your model on the same data you used to train the model!** Doing so is kindof like reusing homework problems verbatim on an algebra exam. The algebra students could get a perfect score on the exam simply by memorizing the answers to each homework problem without learning anything about algebra. This is unsatisfactory, because if faced with a new problem the algebra student would be completely lost. Similarly, under some conditions, ML algorithms are prone to \"memorizing\" responses rather than learning generalizeable patterns. Even in circumstances where the model is not precisely memorizing the data, it will perform at least somewhat better on the training set than on a held-out test set, so one should never expect the performance on the training set to generalize to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate this idea, we will split our data $y$, $X$ into a training set $y_\\mathrm{train}$, $X_\\mathrm{train}$ and a test set $y_\\mathrm{test}$, $X_\\mathrm{test}$. We then train a model on $y_\\mathrm{train}$ and look at the mean accuracy when we test our model on the training set and the test set. By the way, the type of model we use here is called [Logistic Regression](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html)."

But what if our test set happens to be substantially different from the full population that we are sampling from? It may be that we substantially underestimate or worse overestimate the performance of our model. For instance, maybe some Tweets are very easy to classify as attack or non-attack while others are very difficult to classify with a given modeling approach. If we happen to get a larger portion of the easy cases in our test dataset, then our evaluation metrics (precision, recall, F1, ROC-AUC) will be larger than if we had a representative distribution of easier and harder Tweets! This problem is especially pronounced with smaller datasets such as ours. Note that this is not an error of bias, but rather a random statistical error. \n",

    "The problem we encountered above results from a phenomenon called **overfitting**. During the fitting process, the model learns (or memorizes) many of the specifics of the training data. This memorization doesn't apply to new data, so we see a big difference in the performance on the training data and the test data. This difference might be OK as long as the performance on the test set is acceptable. Sometimes to learn generalizeable patterns from the training data, you have to settle for a bit of overfitting. However, too much overfitting will eventually hurt performance. This source of error is sometimes called model _variance_. We'll make this idea more concrete later. \n",

    "The figure below summarizes both of these ideas. We would like to arrive at a model (blue line) which captures the overall behavior of the data (orange dots) and that will generalize well to new data sampled from the same distribution. The straight line model on the left is insufficiently flexible to capture the curved shape of the data and is said to be _underfitting_. The wiggly line model on the right is so flexible that it's fitting random noise in the data rather than the overall behavior and is said to be _overfitting_. The middle model does a good job of capturing the overall behavior of the data and is said to be _juuuuuust right_.\n",

    "Above, we discussed how both overfitting and underfitting can harm the performance of our model. So we should somehow try to minimize them. However, reducing the error resulting from one tends to increase the error resulting from the other. This phenomenon is called the bias-variance tradeoff, where bias and variance are understood to be sources of error resulting from underfitting and overfitting respectively. In particular:\n",
    "  * **Bias error** results from a model that is improperly constrained (or biased) in a way that prevents it from representing the actual patterns in the data, such as the left-most plot above. \n",
    "  * **Variance error** results from a model that is so unconstrained that it fits the noise in the sample dataset preventing it from generalizing well to new data such as the rightmost plot above. The term variance refers to how, since the model is fitting the noise of the sample data, the parameters of the model would change dramatically if trained on a new sample.\n",
    " \n",
    "A good machine learning model finds the sweet spot which balances these two sources of error. But how exactly do we do that? There are many ways, and we won't get into the specific now. However, to demonstrate the idea, we will take our attack data and train progressively more complex models and see how the error changes on the training set and the test set. To acheive this, we again use a Logistic Regression but with progressively larger values for a parameter called the [\"inverse regularization strength\"](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html) or \"C\" for short. The basic idea is that larger values of C result in more flexible models that have more potential for overfitting; small values of C result in less flexible models leading to bias. We will train models for values of C between 0 and 1,000 and plot the result."

But what if our test set happens to be substantially different from the full population that we are sampling from? It may be that we substantially underestimate or worse overestimate the performance of our model. For instance, maybe some Tweets are very easy to classify as attack or non-attack while others are very difficult to classify with a given modeling approach. If we happen to get a larger portion of the easy cases in our test dataset, then our evaluation metrics (precision, recall, F1, ROC-AUC) will be larger than if we had a representative distribution of easier and harder Tweets! This problem is especially pronounced with smaller datasets such as ours. Note that this is not an error of bias, but rather a random statistical error. \n",
