## Scenario: A Miracle Arthiritis Inflamation Cure

Our imaginary colleague "Dr. Maverick" has invented a new miracle drug that
promises to cure arthritis inflammation flare-ups in only 3 weeks! Naturally, we
want to see the clinical trial data, and after months of asking, they have
finally provided us with a spreadsheet containing the clinical trial data.

The file contains the number of inflammation flare-ups per day for the 60
patients in the initial clinical trial, with the trial lasting 40 days. Each row
corresponds to a patient, and each column corresponds to a day in the trial.
Once a patient has their first inflammation flare-up they take the medication
and wait a few weeks for it to take effect and reduce flare-ups.

To see how effective the treatment is we would like to:

1. Calculate the average inflammation per day across all patients.
2. Plot the result to discuss and share with colleagues.

![3-step flowchart shows inflammation data records for patients moving to the Analysis stepwhere a heat map of provided data is generated moving to the Conclusion step that asks the question, How does the medication affect patients?](../fig/python_programming/02-numpy/lesson-overview.svg "Lesson Overview")

### Data Format

The data sets are stored in **comma-separated values** (CSV) format:

- Each row holds information for a single patient.
- Columns represent successive days.

The first three rows of our first file look like this:

```python
0,0,1,3,1,2,4,7,8,3,3,3,10,5,7,4,7,7,12,18,6,13,11,11,7,7,4,6,8,8,4,4,5,7,3,4,2,3,0,0
0,1,2,1,2,1,3,2,2,6,10,11,5,9,4,4,7,16,8,6,18,4,12,5,12,7,11,5,11,3,3,5,4,4,5,5,1,1,0,1
0,1,1,3,3,2,6,2,5,9,5,7,4,5,4,15,5,11,9,10,19,14,12,17,7,12,11,7,4,2,10,5,4,2,2,3,2,2,1,1
```

Each number represents the number of inflammation bouts that a particular patient experienced on a
given day.

For example, value "6" at row 3 column 7 of the data set above means that the third
patient was experiencing inflammation six times on the seventh day of the clinical study.

## Loading data into Python

To begin processing the clinical trial inflammation data, we need to load it
into Python. We can do that using a **library** called
[NumPy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable), which stands for "Numerical Python".
Libraries are collections of Python code written by other people that you can
install and use.

In general, you should use NumPy you want to do fancy things with lots of
numbers, especially if you have matrices or arrays. To tell Python that we'd
like to start using NumPy, we need to **import** it[^installation]:

~~~python
import numpy
~~~

Importing a library is like getting a piece of lab equipment out of a storage
locker and setting it up on the bench. Libraries provide additional
functionality to Python, much like a new piece of equipment adds functionality
to a lab space. Just like in the lab, importing too many libraries can sometimes
complicate and slow down your programs - so we only import what we need for each
program.

Once we've imported the library, we can ask the library to read our data file
for us:

```python
numpy.loadtxt(fname='data/inflammation-01.csv', delimiter=',')
```

```output
array([[ 0.,  0.,  1., ...,  3.,  0.,  0.],
       [ 0.,  1.,  2., ...,  1.,  0.,  1.],
       [ 0.,  1.,  1., ...,  2.,  1.,  1.],
       ...,
       [ 0.,  1.,  1., ...,  1.,  1.,  1.],
       [ 0.,  0.,  0., ...,  0.,  2.,  0.],
       [ 0.,  0.,  1., ...,  1.,  1.,  0.]])
```

The expression `numpy.loadtxt(...)` is a **function call** that asks Python to
run the **function** `loadtxt` of the `numpy` library. The *dot* notation (`.`)
tells Python to look inside the `numpy` library and find the `loadtxt` function.
When you see `numpy.loadtxt`, you can read it as "the `loadtxt` function that
belongs to `numpy`".

As an example, John Smith is the John that belongs to the Smith family. We could
use the dot notation to write his name `smith.john`. `smith` is a container
(family) that holds a lot of people, one of whom is `john`, just as `numpy` is a
container (library) that holds a lot of functions, one of which is `loadtxt`.

`numpy.loadtxt` has two **parameters**: the name of the file we want to read and
the delimiter that separates values on a line. These both need to be
strings, so we put them in quotes.

Since we haven't told it to do anything else with the function's output, the
notebook just displays it. In this case, that output is the data we just loaded.
By default, only a few rows and columns are shown (with `...` to omit elements
when displaying big arrays). Note that, to save space when displaying NumPy
arrays, Python does not show us trailing zeros, so `1.0` becomes `1.`.

Our call to `numpy.loadtxt` read our file but didn't save the data in memory. To
do that, we need to assign the array to a variable. In a similar manner to how
we assign a single value to a variable, we can also assign an array of values to
a variable using the same syntax. Let's re-run `numpy.loadtxt` and save the
returned data:

```python
data = numpy.loadtxt(fname='data/inflammation-01.csv', delimiter=',')
```

This statement doesn't produce any output because we've assigned the output to
the variable `data`. If we want to check that the data have been loaded, we can
print the variable's value:

```python
print(data)
```

```output
[[ 0.  0.  1. ...,  3.  0.  0.]
 [ 0.  1.  2. ...,  1.  0.  1.]
 [ 0.  1.  1. ...,  2.  1.  1.]
 ...,
 [ 0.  1.  1. ...,  1.  1.  1.]
 [ 0.  0.  0. ...,  0.  2.  0.]
 [ 0.  0.  1. ...,  1.  1.  0.]]
```

Now that the data are in memory, we can manipulate them. First, let's ask what
**type** of thing `data` refers to:

```python
print(type(data))
```

```output
<class 'numpy.ndarray'>
```

The output tells us that `data` currently refers to an N-dimensional array, the
functionality for which is provided by the NumPy library. These data correspond
to arthritis patients' inflammation. The rows are the individual patients, and
the columns are their daily inflammation measurements.

With the following command, we can see the array's **shape**:

```python
print(data.shape)
```

```output
(60, 40)
```

The output tells us that the `data` array variable contains 60 rows and 40
columns. When we created the variable `data` to store our arthritis data, we did
not only create the array; we also created information about the array, called
**members** or attributes. This extra information describes `data` in the same
way an adjective describes a noun. `data.shape` is an attribute of `data` which
describes the dimensions of `data`. We use the same "dot" notation for the
attributes of variables that we use for the functions in libraries because they
have the same part-and-whole relationship.

If we want to get a single number from the array, we must provide an **index**
in square brackets after the variable name, just as we do in math when referring
to an element of a matrix.  Our inflammation data has two dimensions, so we will
need to use two indices to refer to one specific value:

```python
print('first value in data:', data[0, 0])
```

```output
first value in data: 0.0
```

```python
print('middle value in data:', data[29, 19])
```

```output
middle value in data: 16.0
```

The expression `data[29, 19]` accesses the element at row 30, column 20. While
this expression may not surprise you, `data[0, 0]` might. Programming languages
like Fortran, MATLAB and R start counting at 1 because that's what human beings
have done for thousands of years. Languages in the C family (including C++,
Java, Perl, and Python) count from 0 because it represents an offset from the
first value in the array (the second value is offset by one index from the first
value). This is closer to the way that computers represent arrays. As a result,
if we have an MÃ—N array in Python, its indices go from 0 to M-1 on the first
axis and 0 to N-1 on the second. It takes a bit of getting used to, but one way
to remember the rule is that the index is how many steps we have to take from
the start to get the item we want.

!['data' is a 3 by 3 numpy array containing row 0: \['A', 'B', 'C'\], row 1: \['D', 'E', 'F'\], androw 2: \['G', 'H', 'I'\]. Starting in the upper left hand corner, data\[0, 0\] = 'A', data\[0, 1\] = 'B',data\[0, 2\] = 'C', data\[1, 0\] = 'D', data\[1, 1\] = 'E', data\[1, 2\] = 'F', data\[2, 0\] = 'G',data\[2, 1\] = 'H', and data\[2, 2\] = 'I', in the bottom right hand corner.](../fig/python_programming/02-numpy/python-zero-index.svg)

```{admonition} In the Corner
:class: note

What may also surprise you is that when Python displays an array,
it shows the element with index `[0, 0]` in the upper left corner
rather than the lower left.
This is consistent with the way mathematicians draw matrices
but different from the Cartesian coordinates.
The indices are (row, column) instead of (column, row) for the same reason,
which can be confusing when plotting data.

```

## Slicing data

An index like `[30, 20]` selects a single element of an array,
but we can select whole sections as well.
For example,
we can select the first ten days (columns) of values
for the first four patients (rows) like this:

```python
print(data[0:4, 0:10])
```

```output
[[ 0.  0.  1.  3.  1.  2.  4.  7.  8.  3.]
 [ 0.  1.  2.  1.  2.  1.  3.  2.  2.  6.]
 [ 0.  1.  1.  3.  3.  2.  6.  2.  5.  9.]
 [ 0.  0.  2.  0.  4.  2.  2.  1.  6.  7.]]
```

The **slice** `0:4` means, "Start at index 0 and go up to, but not including,
index 4". Again, the up-to-but-not-including takes a bit of getting used to, but
the rule is that the difference between the upper and lower bounds is the number
of values in the slice.

We don't have to start slices at 0:

```python
print(data[5:10, 0:10])
```

```output
[[ 0.  0.  1.  2.  2.  4.  2.  1.  6.  4.]
 [ 0.  0.  2.  2.  4.  2.  2.  5.  5.  8.]
 [ 0.  0.  1.  2.  3.  1.  2.  3.  5.  3.]
 [ 0.  0.  0.  3.  1.  5.  6.  5.  5.  8.]
 [ 0.  1.  1.  2.  1.  3.  5.  3.  5.  8.]]
```

We also don't have to include the upper and lower bound on the slice.  If we
don't include the lower bound, Python uses 0 by default; if we don't include the
upper, the slice runs to the end of the axis, and if we don't include either
(i.e., if we use `:` on its own), the slice includes everything:

```python
print(data[:3, 36:])
```

The above example selects rows 0 through 2 and columns 36 through to the end of the array.

```output
[[ 2.  3.  0.  0.]
 [ 1.  1.  0.  1.]
 [ 2.  2.  1.  1.]]
```

## Analyzing data

NumPy has several useful functions that take an array as input to perform operations on its values.
If we want to find the average inflammation for all patients on
all days, for example, we can ask NumPy to compute `data`'s mean value:

```python
print(numpy.mean(data))
```

```output
6.14875
```

`mean` is a **function** that takes an array as an **argument**.


~~~{admonition} Not All Functions Have Input
:class: note

Generally, a function uses inputs to produce outputs. However, some functions
produce outputs without needing any input. For example, checking the current
time doesn't require any input.

```python
import time
print(time.ctime())
```

```output
Sat Mar 26 13:07:33 2016
```

For functions that don't take in any arguments,
we still need parentheses (`()`)
to tell Python to go and do something for us.

~~~

Let's use three other NumPy functions to get some descriptive values about the
dataset. We'll also use multiple assignment, a convenient Python feature that
will enable us to do this all in one line.

```python
maxval, minval, stdval = numpy.amax(data), numpy.amin(data), numpy.std(data)

print('maximum inflammation:', maxval)
print('minimum inflammation:', minval)
print('standard deviation:', stdval)
```

Here we've assigned the return value from `numpy.amax(data)` to the variable `maxval`, the value
from `numpy.amin(data)` to `minval`, and so on.

```output
maximum inflammation: 20.0
minimum inflammation: 0.0
standard deviation: 4.61383319712
```

```{admonition} Mystery Functions in Python
:class: tip

How did we know what functions NumPy has and how to use them? If you are working
in a Jupyter Notebook, there is an easy way to find out. If you
type the name of something followed by a dot, then you can use **tab
completion** (e.g. type `numpy.` and then press <kbd>Tab</kbd>) to see a list of
all functions and attributes that you can use. After selecting one, you can also
add a question mark (e.g. `numpy.cumprod?`), and IPython will return an
explanation of the method! This is the same as doing `help(numpy.cumprod)`.
Similarly, if you are using the "plain vanilla" Python interpreter, you can type
`numpy.` and press the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key twice for a listing of what is
available. You can then use the `help()` function to see an explanation of the
function you're interested in, for example: `help(numpy.cumprod)`.
```

When analyzing data, though, we often want to look at variations in statistical
values, such as the maximum inflammation per patient or the average inflammation
per day. One way to do this is to create a new temporary array of the data we
want, then ask it to do the calculation. For example, let's find the maximum
inflammation of the first patient in the dataset:

```python
patient_0 = data[0, :]
print('maximum inflammation for patient 0:', numpy.amax(patient_0))
```

```output
maximum inflammation for patient 0: 18.0
```

We don't actually need to store the row in a variable of its own. Instead, we
can combine the selection and the function call. Let's use this to get the
maximum inflammation of patient 2 (who, remember is the *third* patient, as in
Python we start counting from zero).

```python
print('maximum inflammation for patient 2:', numpy.amax(data[2, :]))
```

```output
maximum inflammation for patient 2: 19.0
```

What if we need the maximum inflammation for each patient over all days (as in
the next diagram on the left) or the average for each day (as in the diagram on
the right)? As the diagram below shows, we want to perform the operation across
an axis:

![Per-patient maximum inflammation is computed row-wise across all columns usingnumpy.amax(data, axis=1). Per-day average inflammation is computed column-wise across all rows usingnumpy.mean(data, axis=0).](../fig/python_programming/02-numpy/python-operations-across-axes.png)

To support this functionality,
most array functions allow us to specify the axis we want to work on.
If we ask for the average across axis 0 (rows in our 2D example),
we get:

```python
print(numpy.mean(data, axis=0))
```

```output
[  0.           0.45         1.11666667   1.75         2.43333333   3.15
   3.8          3.88333333   5.23333333   5.51666667   5.95         5.9
   8.35         7.73333333   8.36666667   9.5          9.58333333
  10.63333333  11.56666667  12.35        13.25        11.96666667
  11.03333333  10.16666667  10.           8.66666667   9.15         7.25
   7.33333333   6.58333333   6.06666667   5.95         5.11666667   3.6
   3.3          3.56666667   2.48333333   1.5          1.13333333
   0.56666667]
```

As a quick check,
we can ask this array what its shape is:

```python
print(numpy.mean(data, axis=0).shape)
```

```output
(40,)
```

The expression `(40,)` tells us we have an NÃ—1 vector,
so this is the average inflammation per day for all patients.
If we average across axis 1 (columns in our 2D example), we get:

```python
print(numpy.mean(data, axis=1))
```

```output
[ 5.45   5.425  6.1    5.9    5.55   6.225  5.975  6.65   6.625  6.525
  6.775  5.8    6.225  5.75   5.225  6.3    6.55   5.7    5.85   6.55
  5.775  5.825  6.175  6.1    5.8    6.425  6.05   6.025  6.175  6.55
  6.175  6.35   6.725  6.125  7.075  5.725  5.925  6.15   6.075  5.75
  5.975  5.725  6.3    5.9    6.75   5.925  7.225  6.15   5.95   6.275  5.7
  6.1    6.825  5.975  6.725  5.7    6.25   6.4    7.05   5.9  ]
```

which is the average inflammation per patient across all days.

~~~{admonition} Challenge: Slicing Strings
:class: note

A section of an array is called a **slice**.
We can take slices of character strings as well:

```python
element = 'oxygen'
print('first three characters:', element[0:3])
print('last three characters:', element[3:6])
```

```output
first three characters: oxy
last three characters: gen
```

What is the value of `element[:4]`?
What about `element[4:]`?
Or `element[:]`?

:::{dropdown} Solution
```output
oxyg
en
oxygen
```
:::

What is `element[-1]`?
What is `element[-2]`?

:::{dropdown} Solution
```output
n
e
```
:::

Given those answers,
explain what `element[1:-1]` does.

:::{dropdown} Solution
Creates a substring from index 1 up to (not including) the final index,
effectively removing the first and last letters from 'oxygen'
:::

How can we rewrite the slice for getting the last three characters of `element`,
so that it works even if we assign a different string to `element`?
Test your solution with the following strings: `carpentry`, `clone`, `hi`.

:::{dropdown} Solution
```python
element = 'oxygen'
print('last three characters:', element[-3:])
element = 'carpentry'
print('last three characters:', element[-3:])
element = 'clone'
print('last three characters:', element[-3:])
element = 'hi'
print('last three characters:', element[-3:])
```

```output
last three characters: gen
last three characters: try
last three characters: one
last three characters: hi
```

[^installation]: Usually, we would have to first *install* NumPy before we could
    import it. Here we're using an environment that comes with NumPy already
    installed, so we don't need to.
