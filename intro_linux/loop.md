# Loops

**Loops** are a programming construct which allow us to repeat a command
or set of commands for each item in a list.
As such they are key to productivity improvements through automation.
Similar to wildcards and tab completion, using loops also reduces the
amount of typing required (and hence reduces the number of typing mistakes).

Suppose we have several hundred genome data files named `basilisk.dat`, `minotaur.dat`,
and `unicorn.dat`. For this example, we'll use the `exercise-data/creatures`
directory which only has three example files, but the principles can be
applied to many many more files at once.

Let's change to that directory:

```
cd ~/Downloads/shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/creatures
```

and check what's there:

```
$ ls
basilisk.dat minotaur.dat unicorn.dat
```

The structure of these files is the same: the common name, classification,
and updated date are presented on the first three lines, with DNA sequences
on the following lines. These files are pretty long, so let's look at just the beginning of each one using the `head` command:

~~~bash
head -n 5 *.dat
~~~

We would like to print out the classification for each species, which is given
on the second line of each file. To do this, we can combine the `head` command
with the `tail` command, which works like head except it shows lines from the
bottom of it's input. For example:

```
$ tail -n 2 minotaur.dat
TCCAGTCCCA
GCCTTCACGG
```

We get just the last two lines of the file, which are DNA sequences.

To get the classification for a file, we need to execute the command `head -n 2`
to get the first two lines, and pipe this to `tail -n 1` to get the last line of
those two (i.e. the second line, which we know is the classification in each
file).

For example:


```
$ head -n 2 minotaur.dat | tail -n 1
CLASSIFICATION: bos hominus
```

But we want to do this on every file in the directory all at once, not one at at
time. We'll use a loop to solve this problem, but first let's look at the
general form of a loop, using the pseudo-code below:

~~~bash
# The word "for" indicates the start of a "For-loop" command
for thing in list_of_things
#The word "do" indicates the start of job execution list
do
    # Indentation within the loop is not required, but aids legibility
    operation_using/command $thing
# The word "done" indicates the end of a loop
done
~~~

and we can apply this to our example like this:

~~~bash
$ for filename in *.dat
> do
>     echo $filename
>     head -n 2 $filename | tail -n 1
> done
~~~

~~~output
basilisk.dat
CLASSIFICATION: basiliscus vulgaris
minotaur.dat
CLASSIFICATION: bos hominus
unicorn.dat
CLASSIFICATION: equus monoceros
~~~

When the shell sees the keyword `for`, it knows to repeat a command (or group of commands) once for each item in a list. Each time the loop runs (called an iteration), an item in the list is assigned in sequence to the variable, and the commands inside the loop are executed, before moving on to the next item in the list. Inside the loop, we get the variable's value by putting `$` in front of it. The `$` tells the shell to treat something as a variable name and substitute its value in its place, rather than treat it as text or a command.

In this example, the list is three filenames: `basilisk.dat`, `minotaur.dat`, and `unicorn.dat`. Each time the loop iterates, we first use `echo` to print the value that the variable `$filename` currently holds. This is  not necessary for the result, but helpful for us here to have an easier time to follow along. Next, we run the `head` command on the file currently referred to by `$filename`.

- The first time through the loop, `$filename` is `basilisk.dat`. The interpreter runs the command head on `basilisk.dat` and pipes the first two lines to the `tail` command, which then prints the second line of `basilisk.dat`.
- For the second iteration, `$filename` becomes `minotaur.dat`. This time, the shell runs `head` on `minotaur.dat` and pipes the first two lines to the `tail` command, which then prints the second line of `minotaur.dat`.
- For the third iteration, `$filename` becomes `unicorn.dat`, so the shell runs the `head` command on that file, and `tail` on the output of that.

Since the list was only three items, the shell exits the loop after this.

How would you write a loop that uses the `echo` command to print all 10 numbers from 0 to 9?

What is the output of the following code? Why?

Becuase we forgot to use the `$` to tell the shell to treat `number` as a variable name, the shell will print   the literal text `number` 10 times.

```{admonition} Challenge: more variables in Loops
:class: tip

This exercise uses the `shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/alkanes` directory again. Start by changing into this directory:

~~~bash
cd ~/Downloads/shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/alkanes
~~~

`ls *.pdb` gives the following output:

~~~
$ ls *.pdb
cubane.pdb
ethane.pdb
methane.pdb
octane.pdb
pentane.pdb
~~~

What is the output of the following code?

~~~bash
$ for datafile in *.pdb
> do
>     ls *.pdb
> done
~~~

What is the output of the following code?

~~~bash
$ for datafile in *.pdb
> do
>     ls $datafile
> done
~~~

Why do these two loops give different outputs?

```{admonition} Challenge: Limiting Sets of Files
:class: tip

What is the output of running the following loop in the `shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/alkanes` directory?

~~~bash
$ for filename in c*
> do
>     ls $filename
> done
~~~

1. No files are listed.
2. All files are listed.
3. Only `cubane.pdb`, `octane.pdb` and `pentane.pdb` are listed.
4. Only `cubane.pdb` is listed.

:::{admonition} Solution
:class: dropdown

`4.` is the correct answer. `*` matches zero or more characters, so any file name starting with
the letter c, followed by zero or more other characters will be matched.

```{admonition} Challenge: Saving to a File in a Loop - Part One
:class: tip

In the `shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/alkanes` directory, what is the effect
of this loop?

~~~bash
for file in *.pdb
do
    echo $file
    cat $file > test.pdb
done
~~~

1. Prints `cubane.pdb`, `ethane.pdb`, `methane.pdb`, `octane.pdb`, `pentane.pdb` and
  `propane.pdb`, and the text from `propane.pdb` will be saved to a file called `test.pdb`.
2. Prints `cubane.pdb`, `ethane.pdb`, and `methane.pdb`, and the text from all three files
  would be concatenated and saved to a file called `test.pdb`.
3. Prints `cubane.pdb`, `ethane.pdb`, `methane.pdb`, `octane.pdb`, and `pentane.pdb`,
  and the text from `propane.pdb` will be saved to a file called `test.pdb`.
4. None of the above.

:::{admonition} Solution
:class: dropdown

`1.` is the correct answer. The text from each file in turn gets written to the `test.pdb` file.
   However, the file gets overwritten on each loop iteration, so the final content of
  `test.pdb` is the text from the `propane.pdb` file.

```{admonition} Challenge: Spaces in Names
:class: tip

Spaces are used to separate the elements of the list
that we are going to loop over. If one of those elements
contains a space character, we need to surround it with
quotes, and do the same thing to our loop variable.
Suppose our data files are named:

~~~bash
red dragon.dat
purple unicorn.dat
~~~

To loop over these files, we would need to add double quotes like so:

~~~bash
$ for filename in "red dragon.dat" "purple unicorn.dat"
> do
>     head -n 100 "$filename" | tail -n 20
> done
~~~

It is simpler to avoid using spaces (or other special characters) in filenames.

The files above don't exist, so if we run the above code, the `head` command will be unable
to find them; however, the error message returned will show the name of the files it is
expecting:

~~~
head: cannot open 'red dragon.dat' for reading: No such file or directory
head: cannot open 'purple unicorn.dat' for reading: No such file or directory
~~~

Try removing the quotes around `$filename` in the loop above to see the effect of the quote
marks on spaces. Note that we get a result from the loop command for unicorn.dat
when we run this code in the `creatures` directory:

```output
head: cannot open 'red' for reading: No such file or directory
head: cannot open 'dragon.dat' for reading: No such file or directory
head: cannot open 'purple' for reading: No such file or directory
